command from the project root directory:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/tdCorePlugin/trunk plugins/tdCorePlugin

or by using the default symfony plugin install command:

    $ ./symfony plugin:install -s beta tdCorePlugin

as the actual release is in its beta stage. Run the following command to enable
the assets of tdCorePlugin:

    $ ./symfony plugin:publish-assets

Usage
=====

  * This plugin is the main part of the __TD CMF__ and therefore it should be
    installed as the first one. Other td components will use functionalities
    provided with tdCorePlugin.

  * Add __/tdCorePlugin/css/td_core_icons.css__ to your backend/config/view.yml
    in the css section array to enable admin generator icons.

sfAdminDashPlugin compatibility
===============================

The icons provided with the plugin may be used for sfAdminDashPlugin. To do so,
you need to do the following:

  * modify the __sfAdminDashPlugin/config/app.yml__ file, set:

        [php]
        image_dir: /tdCorePlugin/images/icons/

  * and finally you may use the icons in the app.yml file:

        [php]
        categories:
          Administration:
            items:
              Newsletter:
                url: newsletter
                image: newsletter.png

Random Data Generator
=====================

There is a class in the plugin responsible for generating some random data used
for the symfony fixtures. During development phase its essential to see how some
mechanisms work when real data is available in the database. Writing the same
methods many times is useless - that's where random data generator comes in. an
example to generate some data in _data/fixtures/sample.yml_ file is shown below:

    [php]
    <?php $generator = new tdRandomDataGenerator(); ?>
    Guestbook:
    <?php for($i = 0; $i < 150; $i++): ?>
      guestbook_<?php echo $i ?>:
        author: <?php echo $generator->getRandomName()."\n" ?>
        email: <?php echo $generator->getRandomEmail()."\n" ?>
        http: <?php echo $generator->getRandomHttp()."\n" ?>
        text: <?php echo $generator->getRandomText(mt_rand(20,100)*mt_rand(1,5))."\n" ?>
    <?php endfor; ?>
